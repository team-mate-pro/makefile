# Makefile Modules for Symfony Projects

This repository contains re-usable make file commands that should work as aliased for a project maintancened
by "Team Mate Pro" software company.

All projects should follow internal conventions.

## Conventions

### 1. Docker

All projects must be run using `docker` and `docker compose`. Main container should be named `app`.

### 2. Each project must have `Makefile` that defines mandatory variables
